My App!
================

Based on [Webix UI](http://webix.com) and [Webix Jet](https://webix.gitbooks.io/webix-jet/content/chapter1.html)


### Build Systems
Use npm to manage development dependencies.
Use bower to manage front-end library dependencies.
Use gulp to create build tasks

"npm is most commonly used for managing Node.js modules, but it works for the front-end too when combined with Webpack"
"Bower is created solely for the front-end and is optimized with that in mind.
The biggest difference is that npm does nested dependency tree (size heavy) while Bower requires a flat dependency tree
(puts the burden of dependency resolution on the user)."
