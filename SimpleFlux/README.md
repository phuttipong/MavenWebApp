Simple Flux Example
=====================

Sandbox project for learning Flux in Pro-React Chapter 6.

### Objective

This project is purposefully simple to show the minimal Flux with almost no UI (or practical use, for that matter)
 but one that designed to make explicit and well-defined use of all of the elements in a Flux + React application.

### Usage
**Install**
```
npm install
```

**Start the application in development mode**
```
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Static files are served from the `public` folder, project JavaScript files are bundled from the `app` folder.

**When ready, build for production**
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a minimized bundle.js file on the `public` folder.


### Missing Features

This project focuses solely on Flux so it contains very simple React UI.

### Dependencies

* React & React-DOM
* Flux
